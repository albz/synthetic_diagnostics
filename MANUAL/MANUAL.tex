\title{Ray propagation}
	
The axis are defined by the initial rays position. It is defined as 
\subsubsection{Fresnel Propagator Transfer Function}
There are two different solvers, depending if the parater $m$ is explicited. $m$ sets the size of the grid 
\begin{equation}
m=\frac{\delta_2}{\delta_1}
\end{equation}
	
\subsubsection{Refractive index of a dispersive medium}
Refractive index is calculated with the \index{Sellmeier formula}Sellmeier formula, 
\begin{equation}
n^2 \left( \lambda \right)  = 1 + \sum_{i} \frac{B_i \lambda^2}{\lambda^2 - C_i}
\end{equation}
implemented until the third order of the summarization. Sellmeier coefficients are tabulated in 
but can be retrieved elsewhere in literature.

The Sellmeier equation is implemented in the function \index{Sellmeier}Sellmeier()

For not-implemented materials, it is possible to use the ''custom'' material whose coefficients can be declared launching the Sellmeier function.
